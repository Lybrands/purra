# Host-driven recovery worker

Python exports `RecoveryWorker` from `purra.api`; TypeScript exports it from
`purra`. `run_once()` / `runOnce()` discovers persisted Runs, inspects each, skips
reported blockers, and serially awaits the host's resume callback. Duplicate IDs
are processed once per scan. Reopening SQLite and constructing a new worker needs
no in-memory queue reconstruction. SQLite discovery is scoped to its configured
scope and SDK (`list_running()` / `listRunning()`).

The host must restrict discovery to Runs for which it can reconstruct the original
request and current bindings. It must use public Core resume and await the handle's
outcome. Discovery is not authorization, and a diagnosis without blockers is not an
execution permit. The public entry rechecks ownership, scope, configuration,
approvals, effects and budgets. The worker never resets a lease, reconciles an
unknown effect, resumes a terminal Run, or creates a replacement Run.

```python
from purra.api import RecoveryWorker

async def resume(run_id):
    request, options = await host.resolve_run(run_id)
    handle = await core.resume(run_id, request, options=options)
    return await handle.wait()

worker = RecoveryWorker(
    discover=storage.list_running,
    inspect=storage.inspect_recovery,
    resume=resume,
)
report = await worker.run_once()
```

```ts
const worker = new RecoveryWorker({
  discover: () => storage.listRunning(),
  inspect: id => storage.inspectRecovery(id),
  resume: async id => {
    const request = await host.resolveRun(id);
    return (await agent.resume(id, request)).result;
  },
});
const report = await worker.runOnce();
```

A pending approval or unknown claim produces `blocked` without entering Core or
calling the model. Once the host commits its decision or reconciliation, another
scan reads the new state. Inspection/resume exceptions produce per-Run `failed`
results with fixed stage codes, allowing other Runs to proceed. Exception messages
and tool arguments are omitted. Run IDs are internal host diagnostics, not public
progress. `settled` means the callback returned; inspect the canonical Run for its
actual terminal status. Discovery failures reject the scan; overlapping scans on
one worker are rejected. Different workers still compete through Core's existing
lease authority. Python task cancellation propagates; the host owns cancellation
of active Runs and must not equate stopping a scheduler with canceling remote effects.

This is the first W01 scheduling slice, not a completed daemon service. The host
currently schedules scans explicitly. Durable wakeup subscriptions, retry/backoff
policy, bounded batches/fairness, lifecycle/stop controls and capacity measurements
remain open. SQLite discovery currently restores Core state and journal data; it
is not a cheap metadata-only queue query. Do not run a tight polling loop over a
large database. End-to-end service shutdown, process supervision and business
Provider/MCP/downstream operation remain unvalidated.
